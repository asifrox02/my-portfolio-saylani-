              <p class="col-9">My name is Tahira Asif, and I am an Secondary school teacher and mother of three. 
                I have been a teacher for 6 wonderful years and I can’t, at this point in time, 
                imagine doing anything else. I love everything about my job: the curriculum, the 
                content, and most of all, the kids! :)<br>
                <br>I am passionate about creating lessons for my students that get them excited about 
                learning. I believe that learning should be full of engaging activities and 
              
                entertaining content. Yes, it can and should be instructional and fun at the same 
                time!<br>
                <br>I’m an advocate for technology and a huge fan of cool teaching tools that didn’t 
                exist when I went to school. Digital possibilities help me enrich my students’ 
                understanding and create memorable experiences. And I’m happy to share my best 
                practices with you!<br>
                When I’m not in the classroom, I’m busy being a mom to my little son                 who pretty much keep me laughing non-stop! I am inspired every day by my lovely,
                and I am incredibly thankful for every moment in my life. In my spare time, 
                I also enjoy cooking, reading, and exercising.<br>
                <br>I hope you enjoy browsing around my blog, and I love hearing from fellow 
                teachers about all things teaching. So feel free to leave a 
                comment! :)</p>
